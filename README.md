# 🌍 Global Telemedicine Credentialing Network

Welcome to a revolutionary blockchain-based platform that streamlines credential verification for doctors in telemedicine! This project addresses the real-world problem of cross-border credentialing delays, where verifying a doctor's qualifications across countries can take weeks or months due to bureaucratic hurdles, varying standards, and lack of trust in centralized systems. By leveraging the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts, we create a decentralized, immutable network for instant, tamper-proof verification of medical credentials, enabling seamless global telemedicine services while ensuring privacy and compliance.

## ✨ Features

🔒 Secure registration of doctors' credentials with cryptographic proofs  
⏱️ Instant verification of qualifications across borders  
📜 Immutable storage of credential history (issuance, updates, revocations)  
🏥 Support for multiple credential types (e.g., medical degrees, licenses, certifications)  
🔐 Privacy-preserving design using zero-knowledge proofs for selective disclosure  
🌐 Integration with global health authorities as verifiers/issuers  
💰 Token-based incentives for verifiers and low-cost verification fees  
📊 Audit trails for regulatory compliance  
🚫 Revocation mechanism for expired or invalid credentials  
🔄 Easy updates for credential renewals without losing historical integrity  

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Doctors**  
- Register your profile and submit credential hashes (e.g., SHA-256 of diplomas or licenses).  
- Request issuance from authorized verifiers (e.g., medical boards).  
- Once issued, credentials are stored on-chain for instant global access.  
- Use selective disclosure to share only necessary details during telemedicine consultations.  

**For Verifiers/Issuers (e.g., Hospitals, Governments)**  
- Register as an authorized entity.  
- Review and issue/revoke credentials via multi-signature approvals.  
- Earn tokens for validation services.  

**For Patients or Platforms**  
- Query the network with a doctor's ID to instantly verify credentials.  
- Get a boolean response or detailed proof without exposing sensitive data.  

The system uses 8 smart contracts written in Clarity to handle different aspects, ensuring modularity, security, and scalability. All interactions are gas-efficient and leverage Stacks' Proof-of-Transfer consensus for Bitcoin-level security.

## 📂 Smart Contracts Overview

1. **UserRegistry.clar**  
   Handles registration of doctors, verifiers, and patients. Stores user profiles (principal addresses, roles) and enforces KYC-like checks via off-chain oracles.

2. **CredentialIssuer.clar**  
   Allows authorized issuers to create and sign new credentials. Includes functions for multi-signature approvals from multiple authorities.

3. **CredentialStorage.clar**  
   Stores credential metadata (hashes, types, expiration dates) in maps. Uses NFTs to represent unique credentials for easy transfer/ownership.

4. **VerificationEngine.clar**  
   Core contract for querying and verifying credentials. Implements zero-knowledge verification logic to confirm validity without revealing full data.

5. **RevocationRegistry.clar**  
   Maintains a list of revoked credentials. Issuers can add revocations, and verifiers check against this before confirming status.

6. **AccessControl.clar**  
   Manages permissions and roles (e.g., only issuers can revoke). Uses trait definitions for extensible access policies.

7. **TokenEconomy.clar**  
   SIP-010 compliant fungible token for fees and incentives. Doctors pay small fees for registrations; verifiers earn rewards for issuances.

8. **AuditLog.clar**  
   Logs all actions (issuances, verifications, revocations) immutably for compliance and dispute resolution. Supports querying by timestamp or user.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Deploy the contracts on the Stacks testnet using Clarinet. Example deployment script:  
```clarity
;; In CredentialIssuer.clar example
(define-public (issue-credential (doctor principal) (credential-hash (buff 32)) (expiry uint))
  (if (is-authorized tx-sender)
    (ok (map-set credentials {doctor: doctor} {hash: credential-hash, expiry: expiry}))
    (err u403)))
```

This project empowers global healthcare by reducing barriers in telemedicine, potentially saving lives through faster access to qualified doctors. Future expansions could include AI-driven fraud detection or integration with electronic health records!
